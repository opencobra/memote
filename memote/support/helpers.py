    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        The metabolic model under investigation.

    Notes
    -----
    A transport reaction is defined as follows:
    1. It contains metabolites from at least 2 compartments and
    2. at least 1 metabolite undergoes no chemical reaction, i.e.,
    the formula and/or annotation stays the same on both sides of the equation.

    A notable exception is transport via PTS, which also contains the following
    restriction:
    3. The transported metabolite(s) are transported into a compartment through
    the exchange of a phosphate.

    An example of tranport via PTS would be
    pep(c) + glucose(e) -> glucose-6-phosphate(c) + pyr(c)

    Reactions similar to transport via PTS (referred to as "modified transport
    reactions") follow a similar pattern:
    A(x) + B-R(y) -> A-R(y) + B(y)

    Such modified transport reactions can be detected, but only when a formula
    field exists for all metabolites in a particular reaction. If this is not
    the case, transport reactions are identified through annotations, which
    cannot detect modified tranport reactions.
