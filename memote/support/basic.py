    Return all potential non growth-associated maintenance reactions.

    From the list of all reactions that convert ATP to ADP select the reactions
    that match a defined reaction string and whose metabolites are situated
    within the main model compartment. The main model compartment is the
    cytosol, and if that cannot be identified, the compartment with the most
    metabolites.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        The metabolic model under investigation.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        Reactions that qualify as non-growth associated maintenance reactions.

    Notes
    -----
    [1]_ define the non-growth associated maintenance (NGAM) as the energy
    required to maintain all constant processes such as turgor pressure and
    other housekeeping activities. In metabolic models this is expressed by
    requiring a simple ATP hydrolysis reaction to always have a fixed minimal
    amount of flux. This value can be measured as described by [1]_ .

    Notes
    -----
    According to [1]_ this is a good quality indicator expressing the degree of
    metabolic coverage i.e. modeling detail of a given reconstruction. The
    authors explain that models with a 'high level of modeling detail have
    ratios >1, and [models] with low level of detail have ratios <1'. They
    explain that 'this difference arises because [models] with basic or
    intermediate levels of detail often include many reactions in which several
    gene products and their enzymatic transformations are ‘lumped’'.
