def get_smallest_compound_id(compounds_identifiers):
    """
    Return the smallest KEGG compound identifier from a list.

    KEGG identifiers may map to compounds, drugs or glycans prefixed
    respectively with "C", "D", and "G" followed by at least 5 digits. We
    choose the lowest KEGG identifier with the assumption that several
    identifiers are due to chirality and that the lower one represents the
    more common form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    compounds_identifiers : list
        A list of mixed KEGG identifiers.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The KEGG compound identifier with the smallest number.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When compound_identifiers contains no KEGG compound identifiers.

def map_metabolite2kegg(metabolite):
    """
    Return a KEGG compound identifier for the metabolite if it exists.

    First see if there is an unambiguous mapping to a single KEGG compound ID
    provided with the model. If not, check if there is any KEGG compound ID in
    a list of mappings. KEGG IDs may map to compounds, drugs and glycans. KEGG
    compound IDs are sorted so we keep the lowest that is there. If none of
    this works try mapping to KEGG via the CompoundMatcher by the name of the
    metabolite. If the metabolite cannot be mapped at all we simply map it back
    to its own ID.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metabolite : cobra.Metabolite
        The metabolite to be mapped to its KEGG compound identifier.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        If the metabolite could not be mapped.

        An existing mapping from cobra.Metabolite to KEGG compound identifier

def find_thermodynamic_reversibility_index(reactions):

    Return the reversibility index of the given reactions.

    To determine the reversibility index, we calculate
    the reversibility index ln_gamma (see [1]_ section 3.5) of each reaction
    using the eQuilibrator API [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
        reactions: list of cobra.Reaction
            A list of reactions for which to calculate the reversibility index.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        list of cobra.Reaction, index pairs
            A list of pairs of reactions and their reversibility indexes.
        list of cobra.Reaction
            A list of reactions which contain at least one metabolite that
            could not be mapped to KEGG on the basis of its annotation.
        list of cobra.Reaction
            A list of reactions for which it is not possible to calculate the
            standard change in Gibbs free energy potential. Reasons of failure
            include that participating metabolites cannot be broken down with
            the group contribution method.
        list of cobra.Reaction
            A list of reactions that are not chemically or redox balanced.
