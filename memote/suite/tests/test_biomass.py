"""
Supporting functions for stoichiometric consistency checks.

N.B.: We parametrize each function here with the identified biomass reactions.
In the storage of test results we rely on the order of the biomass fixtures
to remain the same as the parametrized test cases.

`pytest.biomass_reactions` and `pytest.biomass_ids` are injected into the
pytest namespace by the plugin. This is done because we cannot simply use a
fixture using `model` to find the biomass reactions and then inject them into
`pytest.mark.parametrize` and neither can we use global variables that will use
the fixture.
