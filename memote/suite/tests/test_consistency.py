    Expect that the stoichiometry is consistent.

    Stoichiometric inconsistency violates universal constraints:
    1. Molecular masses are always positive, and
    2. On each side of a reaction the mass is conserved.
    A single incorrectly defined reaction can lead to stoichiometric
    inconsistency in the model, and consequently to unconserved metabolites.
    Similar to insufficient constraints, this may give rise to cycles which
    either produce mass from nothing or consume mass from the model.

    Expect that no energy metabolite can be produced out of nothing.

    When a model is not sufficiently constrained to account for the

    metabolites to the model without requiring nutrient uptake. These cycles
    are referred to as erroneous energy-generating cycles. Their effect on the
    predicted growth rate in FBA may account for an increase of up to 25%,
    which makes studies involving the growth rates predicted from such models
    unreliable.
