    Show the ratio of the absolute largest and smallest non-zero coefficients.

    This test will return the absolute largest and smallest, non-zero
    coefficients of the stoichiometric matrix. A large ratio of these values
    may point to potential numerical issues when trying to solve different
    mathematical optimization problems such as flux-balance analysis.

    To pass this test the ratio should not exceed 10^9. This threshold has
    been selected based on experience, and is likely to be adapted when more
    data on solver performance becomes available.

    Implementation:
    Compose the stoichiometric matrix, then calculate absolute coefficients and
    lastly use the maximal value and minimal non-zero value to calculate the
    ratio.
