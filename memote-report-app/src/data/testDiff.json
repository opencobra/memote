Such\n    reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not\n    have a  physical correspondence. Exchange reactions, often represented as\n    'R_EX_', can operate in the negative (uptake) direction or positive\n    (secretion) direction. By convention, a negative flux through an exchange\n    reaction represents uptake of the corresponding metabolite, and a positive\n    flux represent discharge.' Every exchange reaction should be annotated with\n    this. Exchange reactions differ from demand reactions in that the\n    metabolites are removed from or added to the extracellular\n    environment only.",
