------------------
* Fix test titles and descriptions.

0.8.5 (2018-08-20)

0.8.3 (2018-07-16)
------------------
* ``memote run`` in a repository now immediately commits the result to the
  deployment branch.

0.8.2 (2018-07-16)

  category are grouped logically.
* Updated the documentation to include a newer flowchart, up-to-date getting
  started and custom test sections.

  cobrapy (0.13.0) and subsequently unpin cobrapy dependency (set to >=0.13.0).

------------------
* Allow users to selective recompute the history of results.
* Skip commits in the history that did not change the model file.

* Fix issues with asynchronicity on the diff report.
* Change format_type on experimental tests from ``count`` to ``percent``
* Fix typo in ``test_basic.py`` that lead to tests returning `null` which

  ``find_metabolites_not_consumed_with_open_bounds``
* Add test ``find_duplicate_metabolites_in_compartments`` to detect duplicate

0.6.2 (2018-03-12)
------------------

* Test summary only displays extended narrative summary describing test,
  and not one-line summary describing expected function behavior/output
* Fix the following bugs:
    - Fix type annotation on the test for Biomass Production in Complete Medium
    - Fix TypeError when running memote new which was associated with unicode
      and string formatting in py2.7
    - Sort existing test results from misc into the respective categories
      (by editing test_config.yml)
    - Move Matrix statistics category to unscored side into their own card
    - Add a tuple of (number of reactions, number of genes) to the data
      annotation of the metabolic coverage test.
* Add filter in ``report_data_service`` that changed the test result status to
  "error" when the data attribute is ``null``, thus avoiding that the report
  interface breaks when trying to access data.
* Add test for identifying stoichiometrically balanced cycles in models
* Correct the arguments used for repositories such that ``memote run`` and
  ``memote history`` work as expected inside of a repository.

0.6.1 (2018-03-01)
------------------

* Emergency fix for distributing required JSON file.

0.6.0 (2018-02-27)
------------------

* Let Travis re-package the snapshot report with every release.
* Add new module to test for the presence of SBO term annotations.
* Add a test for Biomass production in complete medium.
* Clarify extend of mass- and charge-imbalance testing.
* Remove much of the boilerplate code of the report template as a preparation
  for the history and diff report.
* Fix bug with test_blocked_reactions
* Update the testData.json with data from the previous release
* Fix a small bug with the metrics of mass/charge unbalanced reactions.
* Correctly invert the found identifiers in wrong annotations and namespace
  consistency in order to report the correct results.
* Add a cross-reference shortlist using MetaNetX flatfiles
* Add a script that can be used to add more metabolites and then to
  re-generate the shortlist
* Add helper function ``find_met_in_model`` which looks up a query metabolite
  ID using the MNX namespace in the shortlist and:

    - If no compartment is provided, returns a list of all possible candidates
      metabolites.
    - If a compartment is provided, tries to return a list containing only
      ONE corresponding metabolite.

* Add helper function ``find_compartment_id_in_model`` to identify
  compartments using an internal shortlist of possible compartment names.
* Provide tests for each function
* Refactor code to use these functions specifically:
    - ``find_ngam``
    - ``find_biomass_reaction``
    - ``detect_energy_generating_cycles``
    - ``find_exchange_rxns``
    - ``find_demand_rxns``
    - ``find_sink_rxns``
    - ``gam_in_biomass``
    - ``find_biomass_precursors``
* Improve ``find_ngam`` in addition to agnostically looking for ATP hydrolysis
  reactions, the test now also looks for a range of possible "buzzwords" in
  the reaction NAME: ['maintenance', 'atpm', 'requirement', 'ngam',
  'non-growth', 'associated']. One match suffices as a classification.
* Improve ``find_biomass_reaction`` to look for three attributes in a biomass
  reaction, one of which is sufficient to classify it as a biomass reaction:

    1. "Buzzwords" in the reaction ID: ['biomass', 'growth', 'bof']
    2. An annotation matching the SBO-Term SBO:0000630 specifically!
    3. Containing a metabolite matching the regex:
       ``^biomass(_[a-zA-Z]+?)*?$`` (case-insensitive)
* Add function ``bundle_biomass_components`` to identify whether a given
  biomass reaction is 'split' or 'lumped'. This function looks simply at the
  size of the biomass reaction. Based on a guess-timated cut-off the reaction
  is then classified. If it is 'lumped' it is returned without changes, if it
  is 'split' the reactions of any non-energy precursor metabolite are returned
  as well. This is based on the assumption that a 'split' biomass reaction has
  the following structure:
  a (1 gDW ash) + b (1 gDW phospholipids) + c (free fatty acids) +
  d (1 gDW carbs) + e (1 gDW protein) + f (1 gDW RNA) + g (1 gDW DNA) +
  h (vitamins/cofactors)-> 1 gDCW biomass.
  We're supposing that for each macromolecule precursor metabolite there is a
  single reaction defining its composition i.e. ``e`` = protein would have the
  reaction: ``alanine + asparagine + ... + valine --> e``
* Add function, test and model test to identify missing essential precursors
  to the biomass reaction.
  The function is ``essential_precursors_not_in_biomass``
* Record the score of individual test cases and sections in the result output.
* Correct the import of module 'annotation' with 'sbo' in ``test_sbo.py``
* Refactor sink_react_list to sink_reactions for improved readability
* Allow ``test_sink_specific_sbo_presence`` to be skipped when no sink reactions
  are present with a metric of 1.0
* Fix a bug that compared the length of a float to generate a metric in
  ``test_basic.py`` and generated a TypeError.
* Fix a bug that prevented ``find_biomass_precursors``
  in ``memote/support/biomass.py`` from functioning due to a malformed set
* In CONTRIBUTING.rst replace link to semantic commit guide by seesparkbox
  with link to guide by karma, due to error with sphinx linkcheck.
* Fix a bug that prevented ``find_biomass_precursors`` from correctly
  identifying ``atp`` and ``h2o`` metabolites in cobra model reactions
* Fix improperly labeled sbo terms for biomass production in ``biomass.py``
  and ``test_for_helpers.py``.
* Add matrix conditioning functions in ``matrix.py`` which are used for
  model stoichiometric matrix testing in ``test_matrix.py``
* Add missing rank and nullspace_basis functions in ``consistency_helpers.py``
* Fix issue with improper string/dict formatting in ``test_biomass.py`` tests
* Re-organize the architecture to read in external configurations and add
  custom tests.
* Add an argument ``--location`` which replaces ``--directory`` which can be
  used to set the directory or database where results should be stored.
