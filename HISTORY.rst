-------------------

* Fix ``memote online``, given breaking changes in Github Authentication.
* Replace travis-CI with github actions.
* (Cookiecutter) Add an action for comparing models in Pull
  Requests (`#23 <https://github.com/opencobra/cookiecutter-memote/pull/23>`_).

  standard library or newer version of the package.

0.13.0 (2021-06-12)
-------------------

  could occur with irreversible reactions whose bounds constrain flux to the
  reverse direction.

0.12.1 (2021-06-12)
-------------------
* Fix problems with spreadsheet parser. Now supports ``.xls``, ``.xlsx``, and ``.ods``.

  metabolites with open bounds. It allows multiprocessing, currently relying on
  `cobra.Configuration` to select the number of processors.

0.9.11 (2019-04-23)
-------------------
* Pin cobrapy version to <= 0.14.2 (because cobra==0.15.1,0.15.2 SBML parsing

  on Travis).
* Replace any commit operations through gitpython with direct subprocess
  invocations of git.
* Regenerate the mock repo we use in some tests so that filemode changes are
  ignored by default.

* Remove our dependecy on PyGithub and TravisPy by reimplementing all the
  necessary steps with `requests`
* Add unit and integration tests for `runner.py` and `reports.py`, except
  for `memote online`.
* Debug `memote online` - could only be tested manually, CI is impossible
  without a secure way of storing github credentials.
* Add logging statements to all CLI functions to facilitate future debugging.

0.9.3 (2019-01-30)
------------------
* Enhance the function for finding unique metabolites and make it more robust.

* In the reports, improve the descriptions of the 'Help' section and rename this section to 'Readme'.
* Rename the principal sections and include a brief explanation for each.
* Fix bug that would show a test as 'Errored' although it only failed. Fixed by making condition in errorFailsafe

* Read SBML files with modified parser that can collect the level, version and
  whether the FBC package is used.
* Validate the SBML structure with the libSBML python API if the parser errors
  and produce a simple SBML validation report.
* Add test cases that report on the level and version, and FBC availability
  through the memote reports.

-------------------
* Temporarily pin pytest to <4.1 in order to avoid a breaking API change on their part.

0.8.10 (2018-12-21)
-------------------
* Refactor the test for enzyme complexes to only return an estimated size.

0.8.9 (2018-12-11)
------------------
* Compress JSON and SQLite storage of results using gzip by default. JSON
  continues to work either compressed or uncompressed. At the moment we
  offer no database migration, please contact us if you need help in
  migrating a large existing SQLite database rather than just re-computing it.

0.8.8 (2018-12-10)
------------------
* Adjust the reversibility index test to not use name matching and increase
  the threshold slightly. Also adjust the description of the test.

  namespace for the Systems Biology Ontology.
* Remove that metabolite SBO terms are used when identifying transport
  reactions as this may lead to false positives.

  serialization errors.
* Identify transport reactions first by formula then by annotation.
* For the diff report, run pytest in different processes to avoid accidentally
  overwriting the results of the former with the results of the later runs.
* In the diff report, fix a typo that allowed the diff button to depart the
  defined colour scheme (blue -> red) to cyan.
* Fix the snapshot report not showing environment information.
* Allow ``memote run`` to skip commits where the model was not
  changed, if the flag ``--skip-unchanged`` is provided.

0.6.2 (2018-03-12)
------------------

* Test summary only displays extended narrative summary describing test,
  and not one-line summary describing expected function behavior/output
* Fix the following bugs:
    - Fix type annotation on the test for Biomass Production in Complete Medium

    - Add a tuple of (number of reactions, number of genes) to the data
      annotation of the metabolic coverage test.
* Add filter in ``report_data_service`` that changed the test result status to
  "error" when the data attribute is ``null``, thus avoiding that the report
  interface breaks when trying to access data.
* Add test for identifying stoichiometrically balanced cycles in models
* Correct the arguments used for repositories such that ``memote run`` and
  ``memote history`` work as expected inside of a repository.

0.6.1 (2018-03-01)
------------------

* Emergency fix for distributing required JSON file.

0.6.0 (2018-02-27)
------------------

* Let Travis re-package the snapshot report with every release.
* Add new module to test for the presence of SBO term annotations.
* Add a test for Biomass production in complete medium.
* Clarify extend of mass- and charge-imbalance testing.
* Remove much of the boilerplate code of the report template as a preparation
  for the history and diff report.
* Fix bug with test_blocked_reactions
* Update the testData.json with data from the previous release
* Fix a small bug with the metrics of mass/charge unbalanced reactions.
* Correctly invert the found identifiers in wrong annotations and namespace
  consistency in order to report the correct results.
* Add a cross-reference shortlist using MetaNetX flatfiles
* Add a script that can be used to add more metabolites and then to
  re-generate the shortlist
* Add helper function ``find_met_in_model`` which looks up a query metabolite
  ID using the MNX namespace in the shortlist and:

    - If no compartment is provided, returns a list of all possible candidates
      metabolites.
    - If a compartment is provided, tries to return a list containing only
      ONE corresponding metabolite.

* Add helper function ``find_compartment_id_in_model`` to identify
  compartments using an internal shortlist of possible compartment names.
* Provide tests for each function
* Refactor code to use these functions specifically:
    - ``find_ngam``
    - ``find_biomass_reaction``
    - ``detect_energy_generating_cycles``
    - ``find_exchange_rxns``
    - ``find_demand_rxns``
    - ``find_sink_rxns``
    - ``gam_in_biomass``
    - ``find_biomass_precursors``
* Improve ``find_ngam`` in addition to agnostically looking for ATP hydrolysis
  reactions, the test now also looks for a range of possible "buzzwords" in
  the reaction NAME: ['maintenance', 'atpm', 'requirement', 'ngam',
  'non-growth', 'associated']. One match suffices as a classification.
* Improve ``find_biomass_reaction`` to look for three attributes in a biomass
  reaction, one of which is sufficient to classify it as a biomass reaction:

    1. "Buzzwords" in the reaction ID: ['biomass', 'growth', 'bof']
    2. An annotation matching the SBO-Term SBO:0000630 specifically!
    3. Containing a metabolite matching the regex:
       ``^biomass(_[a-zA-Z]+?)*?$`` (case-insensitive)
* Add function ``bundle_biomass_components`` to identify whether a given
  biomass reaction is 'split' or 'lumped'. This function looks simply at the
  size of the biomass reaction. Based on a guess-timated cut-off the reaction
  is then classified. If it is 'lumped' it is returned without changes, if it
  is 'split' the reactions of any non-energy precursor metabolite are returned
  as well. This is based on the assumption that a 'split' biomass reaction has
  the following structure:
  a (1 gDW ash) + b (1 gDW phospholipids) + c (free fatty acids) +
  d (1 gDW carbs) + e (1 gDW protein) + f (1 gDW RNA) + g (1 gDW DNA) +
  h (vitamins/cofactors)-> 1 gDCW biomass.
  We're supposing that for each macromolecule precursor metabolite there is a
  single reaction defining its composition i.e. ``e`` = protein would have the
  reaction: ``alanine + asparagine + ... + valine --> e``
* Add function, test and model test to identify missing essential precursors
  to the biomass reaction.
  The function is ``essential_precursors_not_in_biomass``
* Record the score of individual test cases and sections in the result output.
* Correct the import of module 'annotation' with 'sbo' in ``test_sbo.py``
* Refactor sink_react_list to sink_reactions for improved readability
* Allow ``test_sink_specific_sbo_presence`` to be skipped when no sink reactions
  are present with a metric of 1.0
* Fix a bug that compared the length of a float to generate a metric in
  ``test_basic.py`` and generated a TypeError.
* Fix a bug that prevented ``find_biomass_precursors``
  in ``memote/support/biomass.py`` from functioning due to a malformed set
* In CONTRIBUTING.rst replace link to semantic commit guide by seesparkbox
  with link to guide by karma, due to error with sphinx linkcheck.
* Fix a bug that prevented ``find_biomass_precursors`` from correctly
  identifying ``atp`` and ``h2o`` metabolites in cobra model reactions
* Fix improperly labeled sbo terms for biomass production in ``biomass.py``
  and ``test_for_helpers.py``.
* Add matrix conditioning functions in ``matrix.py`` which are used for
  model stoichiometric matrix testing in ``test_matrix.py``
* Add missing rank and nullspace_basis functions in ``consistency_helpers.py``
* Fix issue with improper string/dict formatting in ``test_biomass.py`` tests
* Re-organize the architecture to read in external configurations and add
  custom tests.
* Add an argument ``--location`` which replaces ``--directory`` which can be
  used to set the directory or database where results should be stored.
